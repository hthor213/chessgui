# 218: Bot Roster & Exhibition Play

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** 214 (what a persona IS — books, policies, priors, eval harness), 210 (match runner + tournament UI), 216 (honest strength labels), 213 (Maia plumbing)
**Origin:** user feedback 2026-07-15, playing the dad-sim — six items, near-verbatim:
move numbers "for easier reference in 'didn't feel like him'"; back/forward review
("wait, what did you do"); avatar pictures; "ability to select players to compete"
with engines/bots as both players ("that way I can see fischer kasparov play");
rename "Spar vs Dad" → "Play vs Bot" (dad becomes one bot, uniquely with 'improve
profile' / 'play'); bots available in tournament. Consolidated into this spec per
user decision 2026-07-15 ("yes, new spec"); spec:214/210/217 cross-reference here.

## Goal

One roster of bots — engines and personas, with faces — consumed by every surface
that fields an opponent: the Play vs Bot tab, the tournament/exhibition, and the web
arena. Pick any bot to play; pick any two to watch.

## Glossary (mentor review 2026-07-15)

- **Rival** — a real person we model (dad, the chess.com rivals); private individuals
  stay local per spec:214's hard rules.
- **Persona** — the model of a player: book + policy + priors (spec:214).
- **Bot** — a roster entry visible in the UI.
- **Participant** — the runtime object a surface spawns to field an opponent, engine
  or persona (below).

Move selection is owned by spec:214's persona engine contract; 218 owns surfacing.

## The Participant

The architectural core is one object:

```
{ id, displayName, avatar?, kind: uci | persona, enginePath | personaConfig }
```

consumed by three surfaces:

1. **Play vs Bot** (renamed from "Spar vs Dad", Learn sub-tab): human vs one roster
   entry. The private rival persona is the only entry with two actions — **Play**
   and **Improve profile** (= the shipped serious/probe spar modes, spec:214); all
   others get **Play** only.
2. **Exhibition / Tournament** (spec:210): pick any two roster entries, assign sides
   explicitly, watch them play — Fischer vs Kasparov in-app.
3. **Persona Arena** (spec:217): the web surface of the same roster; its lobby
   consumes this definition (including the avatar field) rather than redefining it.

### The persona arm (why a persona is not a UCI binary)

The match runner spawns bare binary paths and takes argmax `bestmove`. A shim script
would launch lc0 but lose temperature sampling, the persona book, the policy floor,
and the draw model — it would launch, but it would not be the persona. The seam is a
Rust Participant enum (`UciBinary(path)` | `Persona{book, weights, sampling, nodes}`)
at the single per-move call site in the game loop; the persona arm reuses the
existing Maia plumbing (extended to arbitrary weights) plus persona policy sampling.
The persona arm serves ALL personas — friends-and-family personas (Maia-band
policies + their own-game books) and GM-strength personas (the BT3 strong net)
alike; only the policy backend differs per entry (spec:214 Tier 2 config). The same
abstraction serves spec:217's server-side roster.

## Decisions (2026-07-15, user)

1. **Avatars: caricature portrait art for everyone**, based on public photos, "so
   you can see who it is" — the stylized-likeness route; no licensed-photo shipping.
   Private individuals: source photos AND generated caricatures stay local-only
   (never bundled/committed — spec:214 hard rule); public figures' caricatures may
   ship bundled.
2. **This spec is the one home** for roster/surfaces/exhibition (was: edits spread
   across 214/210).
3. **Exhibition ships now, upgrades over time**: start with Fischer and Kasparov at
   the best fidelity currently available (Maia-band first, the BT3 persona arm when
   ported), always with spec:216 honest strength labels — "to be updated" is
   acceptable and expected. Friends-and-family personas join as they are modeled
   (spec:214); the roster is not GM-only.
4. **Roster v1 = everything**: the private rival + all modeled friends/family
   (local-only entries) + Fischer + Kasparov + the Maia strength bands; future canon
   entries (spec:217 roster) appear as they're extracted.
5. **Tournament picker UI: one simple dropdown**, kind-prefixed labels — "engine:
   stockfish 18", "engine: reckless", "bot: dad", "bot: kasparov". No separate
   roster-browser screen in the tournament tab; the card-style roster browser with
   avatars belongs to Play vs Bot.
6. **Disclosure, not consent paperwork**, for using relatives' games and fielding
   their personas: the family sticker, recorded in spec:217 Transparency ("note:
   your son may use your games — study them in order to try to beat you in chess
   at Christmas"). The app is for the user, then dad; a formal ToU is deferred
   until/unless the app is ever published beyond family (user, 2026-07-15).

Implementation detail settled without user (small fork, 2026-07-15): the
back/forward review mechanic is copied in place in the spar tab first; it gets
extracted into a shared component when the exhibition viewer gains its SAN move
list, not before.

## Decision (2026-07-17, user): GM persona strength is explicit, never a silent cap

The old card copy ("~1900 policy approximation; full-strength persona
available in Tournament") described a real constraint — the spar arm could
only drive Maia bands until the BT3 managed-net port (2026-07-17) — but as
a product it reads as "a 1900 bot in a Kasparov costume", which the user
rejects. Rule now:

- A GM persona card offers a **strength selector**: **Full strength**
  (BT3 policy + his book + verification reweight) and the Maia bands
  (1900/1700/1500/1300/1100 approximations with his book). No silent cap.
- Labels tell the truth per selection: full = "his openings, full-strength
  policy"; band = "his openings, ~N approximation". The honesty gate keeps
  its job — it gates CLAIMS (a band pick may not claim to be Kasparov's
  real strength), it no longer forces a cap the engine doesn't have.
- Full strength downloads the ~190MB net on first use — the card says so
  instead of surprising the user; while absent/undownloaded the serving
  fallback stays Maia-1900 and the UI shows which backend actually served
  (the decision log already records it).

## Hard rules

spec:214's hard rules apply wholesale: personas of private individuals — including
their avatar images, source photos, books, and roster metadata — stay LOCAL
(data/rivals or app data, gitignored, never bundled); committed spec/UI text refers
to private personas generically; every persona match and roster card shows measured
strength (spec:216 curve) — no unmeasured realism claims.

## Checklist

### Ship-now polish (no roster dependency)

- [x] Move numbers in the spar/Play-vs-Bot move list (2026-07-15, user request):
      numbered move pairs, so realism-feedback notes can cite "12.Nxe5" instead of
      prose — strengthens the shipped feedback ground-truth stream (spec:214).
      (headless-verified, user eyeball pending) Landed in the tournament live
      viewer too (2026-07-15, spec:210 Phase 4 tick-pass): `app/page.tsx`'s
      `LiveGameView` now renders the same numbered SAN move list alongside the
      "game #N · move M" counter (which stays, for the compact live status
      line), reusing the exhibition viewer's exact `sansFromUci`/`numberMoves`
      reconstruction path — see spec:210's checklist for detail.
- [x] Back/forward review during a live game (2026-07-15, user request — "he
      captured with the knight on e5 and I think he captured my knight (I know he
      did), but it helps to have back/forward to see better what he's planning...
      similar to how one might ask in a friendly game 'wait, what did you do'"):
      port the spec:210 Phase 8 ply-nav pattern (per-ply frame history, arrow keys,
      snap back to live). Review-only — renders a derived position and never
      mutates the live game; board interaction suppressed while browsing; snaps
      back to live on the opponent's move or "go live". Explicitly NOT takeback
      (the destructive control / spec:010 undo is a different mechanic).
      (headless-verified, user eyeball pending)

### Roster

- [ ] Own-persona entry (2026-07-15, promised to dad via Messenger — spec:217
      "Promises"): the logged-in/local player's OWN persona appears in their
      roster when one exists (dad sees "You"; private-persona rules apply). In
      the arena lobby this is per-account; in the local app it is the user's
      self-persona if built.
      Local-app half code-verified 2026-07-16: `scripts/persona/build_self_persona.py`
      builds `self.book.json`/`self.config.json` (kind `"self"`, gitignored) and
      `lib/roster.ts` surfaces "You" first, gated on kind + built book, excluded
      from the rival loop (2 roster tests). Arena-lobby per-account half NOT yet
      built — box stays unticked until that lands.
      Arena export tooling code-verified 2026-07-16: `build_self_persona.py
      --arena-staging` packages artifacts + net for scp, server pins Maia nets
      by sha256 (`MAIA_NET_SHA256` in config.py, `_net_verified` in persona.py,
      mismatch = skip-never-invent), and `_strength_label` renders the self
      persona's measured band ("Maia-estimated") instead of "unmeasured".
      Deployment to the homeserver + dad's lobby eyeball still pending.

- [x] Play vs Bot rename + roster (2026-07-15): "Spar vs Dad" → "Play vs Bot"
      (app/page.tsx Learn sub-tab + spar-tab.tsx headings); a roster of
      Participants (lib/roster.ts) replaces the hardcoded RIVAL_LABEL/book —
      the old single-rival "intro" screen is now a card-style roster picker,
      per-entry action set wired (private rival = Play + Improve profile; all
      others = Play only). v1 contents per decision 4: the private rival
      (local book, appears only when it loaded), Fischer, Kasparov, and the
      full Maia 1100-1900 band set. (headless-verified, user eyeball pending)
- [x] Participant config + loader (2026-07-15, lib/roster.ts `buildRoster` +
      the `Participant`/`PersonaConfig` types matching spec:214's `persona`
      payload shape; no `uci`-kind entries populated in v1, the type supports
      them for the later exhibition/tournament item). (headless-verified,
      user eyeball pending)
- [x] Avatars (2026-07-15): avatar field + initials/monogram fallback
      (components/ui/avatar.tsx, `initialsFor()`) rendering on roster cards
      and in-game (opponent header); every v1 entry ships with zero art, as
      the item specifies — the caricature pipeline per decision 1 remains a
      later item, unstarted. (headless-verified, user eyeball pending)

### Exhibition & tournament

- [x] Participant dropdown replaces the two free-text binary paths in the
      tournament tab (decision 5 labels), with explicit per-side assignment
      (Phase 3 `flipFirst` is only half of side selection) (2026-07-15,
      headless-verified, user eyeball pending): one flat dropdown per side
      (`lib/tournament-roster.ts` `buildTournamentRoster`) — two fixed
      engines, BT3 GM personas (`lib/persona-manifest.ts`, live-imported from
      data/personas/*.config.json, mirroring lib/roster.ts's own precedent
      for the same files), the private rival gated by literally reusing
      lib/roster.ts's `buildRoster` (never re-derived), and the Maia bands.
      HONESTY GATE: every GM persona entry carries `weights:"bt3"` + its real
      sampling params + a measured harness move-match label — e.g. "bot:
      kasparov (BT3, 64% move-match)" — never level-only, since
      match_runner.rs's persona arm does support the BT3 managed net (unlike
      Play vs Bot's `persona_move`, which can't, hence that surface's
      approximation-only roster). A new "White in game 1" control (hidden in
      Current-position mode, which keeps its own board-bottom-color control)
      makes the explicit per-side assignment.
- [x] Persona arm in the runner (2026-07-15): Player enum Uci|Persona at the
      per-move call site in match_runner.rs; persona arm and spar persona_move
      share one selection core (persona.rs::select_move_from_policy) so surfaces
      cannot diverge; additive GameOutcome.persona_logs decision-log field;
      persona-vs-UCI integration test ran against real lc0+SF (77 Rust tests
      pass). Live-app exhibition run pending user eyeball.
- [x] Managed weights (2026-07-15): maia.rs MANAGED_NETS registry — BT3 net with
      pinned sha256 + live lczero.org URL; resolution order: PERSONA_BT3_PATH
      local registration → verified cache → download.
- [x] Exhibition framing: batch of 1 through the existing runner as v1; featured
      single-game presentation (less stats-first); SAN move list with move numbers
      in the live viewer; spec:216 honest strength labels on every persona match
      (2026-07-15, headless-verified, user eyeball pending): "Watch two bots
      play" sends one `GameSpec` (`buildExhibitionSpec`, no color-flip pairing)
      through the same `play_batch` runner. DIVERGES from "in the live
      viewer": the featured single-game presentation (board + eval bar +
      numbered SAN move list, `ExhibitionView` in tournament-tab.tsx) is a
      NEW, separate viewer rendered inline in the tab, not a change to
      app/page.tsx's shared `LiveGameView` (the "game #N · move M" one) —
      that file was out of this task's scope (components/tournament-tab.tsx,
      lib/tournament.ts, lib/game-replay.ts + new files only). Wiring the
      same numbered-move-list fix into the shared live viewer is an open
      follow-up for whichever agent owns app/page.tsx. Persona strength
      labels: spec:216 curve for engines (unchanged), harness move-match %
      for personas (same labels as the dropdown, item 1 above).
- [x] Personas in round-robin standings with spec:216 labels (rides on spec:210
      Phase 6's round-robin item) (code-verified 2026-07-15: spec:210 Phase 6's
      round-robin item already delivers this — persona rows carry their honest
      spec:216 roster labels, e.g. "bot: kasparov (BT3, 64% move-match)", in
      both standings and the saved result)

### Later / uncaptured requirements (audit 2026-07-16)
- [ ] Caricature avatar pipeline for all roster entries (public bundled,
      private local-only; initials fallback stays the interim state).
      (218:63-68,158-162)
- [ ] User picks source photos and approves likenesses. (user-blocked: needs
      the user to supply/approve photos) (218:63-68,158-162)
- [x] Wire the numbered-SAN move list into the shared `LiveGameView`
      (app/page.tsx), not just the exhibition viewer. (218:199-206 "open
      follow-up") (verified 2026-07-17: app/page.tsx:1812-1826 builds moveRows
      via the exhibition viewer's exact path — core/game-replay.ts `sansFromUci`
      + `numberMoves` (:88), one SAN-numbering implementation for both surfaces;
      game-replay.test.ts green; on-screen look stays with the user-eyeball
      items below)
- [ ] Extract back/forward review into a shared component now that the
      exhibition viewer has gained its own SAN move list (the stated trigger
      condition, "small fork ... extracted when the exhibition viewer gains
      its SAN move list", has fired). (218:89-92)
- [ ] User eyeball: move numbers in spar/Play-vs-Bot + live viewer.
      (user-blocked: needs the user in the app) (218:106-114; LAST_SESSION
      Known-issues 4; feedback_testing.md)
- [ ] User eyeball: back/forward live-game review. (user-blocked) (218:115-124)
- [ ] User eyeball: roster picker (Play vs Bot card UI). (user-blocked)
      (218:145-157)
- [ ] User eyeball: avatars (initials/monogram fallback). (user-blocked)
      (218:158-162)
- [ ] User eyeball: tournament Participant dropdown + per-side assignment.
      (user-blocked) (218:166-182)
- [ ] User eyeball: exhibition run (live-app persona-vs-UCI/persona-vs-persona
      game). (user-blocked) (218:183-207)
- [ ] Play-vs-Bot spar arm uses the `persona_move` managed net (BT3) when the
      selected persona supports it, matching the tournament runner's
      capability instead of the Maia-only approximation. (218:179-182 +
      Decision 3)
